You can clone this repository as an Angular2 starter for your projects, instead of using `ng new` and adding every time the things above. 

I'll try to keep it updated with new versions of Angular-CLI, but, after cloning it, you can upgrade it by yourself, folowing [these instructions](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#updating-angular-cli).

Please, refer to [Angular-CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) for more info about generator commands.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/route/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
